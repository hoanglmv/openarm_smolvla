"""The OpenArm dataset contract, as openarm_mc's recorder writes it.

Mirrors openarm_ui/data_recorder.py and openarm_act/policy.py: sixteen
joints in one fixed order, arm joints in rad, grippers as finger stroke in
metres. The policy's state and actions use the same order and units, so
what the server returns can go straight to openarm_act.

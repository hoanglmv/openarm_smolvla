"""A report on the raw episodes, before anything is converted.

Answers the questions the training setup depends on: how much data there is
per task, which episodes would be skipped and why, and whether
joint_commands can serve as labels (how much of it is missing, how far the
arm lags behind it, how far the grippers sit from what they were told).
